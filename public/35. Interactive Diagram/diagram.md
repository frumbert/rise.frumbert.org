This is a balanced tree made up of binary choices - typically yes or no, but accepts any label. Boxes present dichotomies, and the user chooses a branch. Positive and Negative responses are styled differently, but the whole 'tree' balances out in the end, filling the space as best it can.

The text is based on code, so you can have as much or little as you like and don't have to rebuild the physical layout yourself. Some labels have the `|` character, which tells the renderer to draw a second box - so you can present a response, then ask a follow up. Leaf nodes are ones without choices.
