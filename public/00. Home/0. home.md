## About this site

This site hosts scripts and tricks for Articulate Rise. It is also a storage server for the Text Entry interactive html object, which adds long-text support for Scorm 1.2 by storing data in web-accessible pages. There is no public interface to browsing this data - it's accessible only through authorized script access, and the data is up on some encrypted S3 bucket anyway.

Many of these scripts are already up on the [Mighty Code Catalogue](https://community.maestrolearning.com/c/mighty-code-catalog/), and this site is a place where I can do more of a deep dive into code or add extra technical bits and pieces. **Mighty**, by the way, is a [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mighty/iookjkkaipndkbpfiniajpblkmoenidm) that adds lots of functionality to Articulate Rise to make it do things that Articulate won't ever get around to themselves. Very worth the money.
