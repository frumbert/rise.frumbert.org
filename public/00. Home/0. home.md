## About this site

This site hosts scripts and tricks for Articulate Rise. It is also a storage server for the Text Entry interactive html object, which adds long-text support for Scorm 1.2 by storing data in web-accessible pages. There is no public interface to browsing this data - it's accessible only through authorized script access.

check out [text entry](file2.xml) for a test link direct to a file with the linkPrefix added.

> Browse the various scripts to get started.

**syntax highlighting** should now be working.

```js
const foo = document.documentElement.style;

console.log('foo', foo);
```

and some css

```css
:root {
  --var: 1px solid red;
}

main {
  marquee {
    background-color: var(--var, yellow);
    font-size: 72pt;
  }
}
```

lets see that.
