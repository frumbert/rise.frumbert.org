This site hosts scripts and tricks for Articulate Rise (though some can be used standalone or embedded in other ways). It is also a storage server for the interactions you can download from this site. There is no public interface to browsing this data - it's only accessible only through authorized script access, and the data is up on some private encrypted S3 bucket anyway. The data is accessible from scripts, which need a [token](/article/token/).

Many of these scripts are already up on the [Mighty Code Catalogue](https://community.maestrolearning.com/c/mighty-code-catalog/), and this site is a place where I can do more of a deep dive into code or add extra technical bits and pieces. **Mighty**, by the way, is a [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mighty/iookjkkaipndkbpfiniajpblkmoenidm) that adds lots of functionality to Articulate Rise to make it do things that Articulate won't ever get around to themselves. Very worth the money.
