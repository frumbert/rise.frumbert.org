## To run interactions for Scorm 1.2, you need a token.

A token is used by interaction scripts to authorize persisted data for **Scorm 1.2**. If you are only running **Scorm 2004**, you _don't need to set a token_. You can <b>reuse the same token</b> across multiple interactions or even courses - it's just used to validate the domains that can read/store data. Most of the time you'll probably only need one token.

Tokens are bound to one or more domains. If they are copied or used elsewhere, they don't work.

All interactions are generic and reusable in multiple places.

## Under the hood

All data persisted by ths site is stored on a private, encrypted S3 Bucket, which needs a specific API key and whole rigmarole to get access to. [See this link](/articles/about-interactions/3) for technical details.
