## About Scorm interactions

Scorm 1.2 has a restricted list of valid interaction types.

* **true-false** - a choice with only two possibilities [1,0,t,f, 1 byte]
* **choice** - a question with a limited number of predefined responses from which one or more may be selected [a-z0-9], single characters, csv, curly brackets around all responses denote a correct set, up to 26 individual choices]
* **fill-in** - a question with a one- or few-word answer or response [alphanumeric, 255 bytes]
* **matching** - a question with one or two sets of items, two or more of the members being related [ {a.b}, - where both a and b are single digit a-z0-9; curly brackets surround pairs, period separate pairs, commas separate answers, max 255 bytes]
* **performance** - similar to a multiple choice, the learner must instead perform a task or action [alphanumeric, 255 bytes]
* **sequencing** - the learner must identify a logical order for the members of a list [max 255 bytes, correct answer matching exact order]
* **likert** - the learner selects an option from a continiuum or group of alternatives (rating) [alphanumeric or blank, no correct answer, max 255 bytes]
* **numeric** - a simple number with or without a decimal point [ +/- 3-digits dot 2-digits]

It also has restricitive limitations on which fields can be read or written. Many interaction fields such as `cmi.interactions.n.correct_responses.n.pattern`, `cmi.interactions.n.type` and `cmi.interactions.n.id` and [importantly] `cmi.interactions.n.student_response` are **write only**. It has no space to store a description of a question/interaction, and most packages are already making use of other structures like `cmi.suspend_data`. The one place where we can often store read-write data is `cmi.comments` which can store a maximum of `4096 bytes`.

> **moodle**
> moodle has a problem where cmi.comments is *append only*, which has never been in the SCORM spec - and means that using the field eventually breaks it because of an overflow. You have to modify /mod/scorm/datamodels/scorm_12.js to ensure the model replaces the value instead of appending it. 

Scorm 2004's interactions are effectively the same, except the properties are **read-write**, and a `cmi.interactions.n.description` field exists to describe the interaction (255 bytes).
